# InstaCart Analysis
Worked through data as a data analyst for a mock company (Instant Cart) to discover sale patterns to help the company increase its customer retention. 
# Instant Cart Data Analysis Project
In this project, I was tasked to explore sale patterns and customer behaviors. Diving into the data held information that gave the company a direction to stay ahead in the competitive market of other delivery services. 
## Key Questions
- When are the busiest days and times for their services?
- When do customers spend the most money?
- What are the prices of similar product categories?
- What products are bought frequently?
- What are their customer's behaviors based on region, loyalty to Instant Cart, familial status, and income status?
## Data Source
This project used the open source data from InstantCart. The data set is within the attached files. 
## Final Deliverable
Refer to the attached files to review my work with Python and answer the stakeholders' questions. Within the file, you will see graphs and steps of how I cleaned the original data to have thorough findings that support my answers and provide the best direction in which InstantCart can stay ahead of the competitive market.
